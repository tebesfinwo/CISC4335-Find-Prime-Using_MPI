Simple Application to get total number of primes for given number using MPI. 



Before Running the Programming
==============================
Please compile the source code by "make" on your terminal. 
Beforehand, you need to make sure that GNU and OpenMPI are installed on your machine. 


After compiled, run the following command 

./run.perl mpi_prime 

on your terminal. 


Be patient, it may take awhile for the result to appear your terminal.
